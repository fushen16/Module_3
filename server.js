**   stream object. the page should display the following message:
**   Today is <day name>, <month name> <date>. Here are the available food
**   trucks:
**   list the food trucks returned by filterByDay, passing in the current day
**   name. e.g. filterByDay(day); where "day" is determined using the
**   enhanced-date module. The list of trucks returned will be an array of food
**   truck objects. Iterate through the list, building up a string of food
**   truck names. Once you're done iterating through that list, display the
**   string you built up.
**   Remember that the response is a stream object that must be closed.
